# Building
## Windows
It is expected that you use command-line (preferably Terminal) with MSVC compiler.
- Make sure the `cl` command is availble first.
- Make sure that you have VulkanSDK installed and `VK_SDK_PATH` environment variable is set.
- Then use `99_build.bat` script that will build the whole project.
